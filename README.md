# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

## Objective:
To implement and compare tree-based models like Decision Trees and Random Forests on a classification task using the Heart Disease Dataset.

## Tools:
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Graphviz (for visualization)
- Matplotlib (for plots)

## Highlights:
- Visualized Decision Tree to understand splits and depth.
- Controlled overfitting using max_depth.
- Trained a Random Forest model and interpreted feature importances.
- Performed 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate model robustness.

## Dataset:
[Heart Disease Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction)

## Output:
- Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report
- Decision Tree Visualization
- Feature Importance Plot
